# CQUT-Vegetable-Programmer

A group of code farmers at  Chongqing University of Technology who are interested and love programming

------

## 1.We are students

- We probably spend most of our time doing other things :crystal_ball:
- We are passionate about exploring a wide variety of technologies :mag_right:
- We are passionate about developing collaboratively with others :busts_in_silhouette:

## 2.Interest-oriented programming

- All projects are created out of interest and passion :yum:
- All projects can exercise ability and level :sweat_drops:

- All projects are open source :raised_hands:

## 3.Vegetable Chicken

- Our technology is not mature enough :pencil2:
- Our development experience is relatively small :bookmark_tabs:
- Our tech stack is also not comprehensive enough :triangular_ruler:

In general, we love programming and are keen to explore its mysteries. Although we are still too young and naive, we will continue to move forward on this road, and all kinds of people are welcome to join us.
